I believe, and hope that my research will contribute to solving social problems. 

My dissertation was cited by a recent report on drug shortages by the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs .

I had the opportunity to participate in a stakeholder meeting organized by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Security of America's Medical Product Supply Chain in October 2022. In this meeting, I presented a summary of recent policy updates pertaining to medical supply chains to an audience comprising academics, industry professionals, and policymakers. A supplemenatry article based on this presentation is published in Health Affairs Forefront.
