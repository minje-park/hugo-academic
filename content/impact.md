* I had the opportunity to participate in a stakeholder meeting organized by [**The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Security of America's Medical Product Supply Chain**](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/security-of-americas-medical-product-supply-chain) in October 2022. In this meeting, I presented a summary of recent policy updates pertaining to medical supply chains to an audience comprising academics, industry professionals, and policymakers.
