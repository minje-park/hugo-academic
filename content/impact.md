I believe and hope that my research will contribute to solving social problems. 

* My dissertation has been cited by a recent [**report on drug shortages by The U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs**](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023-06-06-HSGAC-Majority-Draft-Drug-Shortages-Report.-FINAL-CORRECTED.pdf).<br/>
<br/>

* I had the opportunity to participate in a stakeholder meeting organized by [**The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Security of America's Medical Product Supply Chain**](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/security-of-americas-medical-product-supply-chain) in October 2022. In this meeting, I presented a summary of recent policy updates pertaining to medical supply chains to an audience comprising academics, industry professionals, and policymakers. [**A supplementary article**](https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/building-resilience-into-us-prescription-drug-supply-chains) based on this presentation is published in *Health Affairs Forefront*.
