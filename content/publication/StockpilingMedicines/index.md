abstract: "Hospitals with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) demand surges at the
  onset of the pandemic report medication shortages, a worrisome phenomenon as
  inadequate medication supplies negatively affect patient outcomes. The popular
  press implicates a lack of raw ingredients and spikes in purchases but
  rigorous research is needed to more accurately identify shortage causes. We
  leverage a quasi-experimental design on IQVIA’s National Sales Perspectives™
  data from 2018-2020 with a focus on medicines related to U.S. hospital-based
  COVID-19 treatment and a set of control medicines not used for COVID-19. We
  contribute to supply chain theory by empirically demonstrating that
  stockpiling among U.S. medical providers in the early phase of the pandemic
  accounts for the shortages. The buyers’ behavior results in concentration of
  the sales volume of COVID-19 medicines in the first two months of the
  pandemic. After these first two months, the sales volume of drugs for COVID-19
  treatment decreases significantly despite a nationwide increase in
  COVID-19-related hospitalizations. An implication for manufacturers is that
  orders due to stockpiling by downstream buyers early on in a pandemic period
  should be discounted when predicting future demand. We also investigate
  another potential cause: expected price increases in the future. Counter to
  concerns that drug manufacturers would engage in price gouging behavior, we
  find no evidence of price inflation for these drugs. Our results are robust to
  numerous sensitivity checks and have implications for manufacturers,
  hospitals, and policymakers that may improve medicine supply resiliency
  against future threats."
