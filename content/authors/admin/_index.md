I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Business School. My research investigates how organizations can be more resilient when facing disruptions in their environment, with a particular focus on the healthcare industry. 
Before joining HKU, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia Business School, working with [**Carri Chan**](http://www.columbia.edu/~cc3179/), and I earned a PhD from Questrom School of Business, Boston University, advised by [**Anita Carson**](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/anita-carson/).
