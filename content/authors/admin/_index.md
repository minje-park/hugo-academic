I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Decision, Risk, and Operations Division at Columbia Business School, working with Professor [Carri Chan](http://www.columbia.edu/~cc3179/).

I earned a PhD from Questrom School of Business, Boston University, advised by Professor [Anita Carson](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/anita-carson/). My dissertation studies pharmaceutical supply chain disruptions and their impact on buyersâ€™ behaviors, medication errors, and manufacturers' market share.
