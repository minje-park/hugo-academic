summary: INFORMS, 2020
abstract: "We investigate the impact of pharmaceutical supply chain disruptions on patient safety, using the drug shortage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017 as a case study. By applying the synthetic control method (Abadie et al. 2003; 2010), we measure the increase in medication errors and adverse drug events after the supply disruption. With our results, we provide implications for safe substitution between drugs during the supply disruption period."
