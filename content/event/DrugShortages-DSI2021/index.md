summary: DSI 2021
abstract: "We investigate the impact of drug shortages on patient safety by studying a drug shortage case caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017. By applying the synthetic control method (Abadie et al. 2003, 2010), we measure the increase in medication errors and adverse drug events after the supply disruption. With our results, we provide implications for safe substitution between drugs during the supply disruption period."
