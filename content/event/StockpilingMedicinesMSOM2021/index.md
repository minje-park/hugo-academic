summary: MSOM 2021
abstract: "We analyze changes in sales of essential medications to US healthcare providers – hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities – before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. By partnering with a pharmacist and pharmaceutical supply chain expert, we identify a list of drugs that are used for COVID-19 treatments. Using national-level drug sales data from January 2018 to September 2020, we find that sales of drugs for COVID-19 treatments were concentrated in the first two months of the pandemic: about 70% of the pre-pandemic average monthly volume were sold for COVID-19 in March and April 2020, on average. After those two months, the amount of drug sales related to COVID-19 treatments decreased significantly, despite an uptick in COVID-19 related hospitalizations nationwide, indicating stockpiling of drugs occurred at the beginning of the pandemic. To provide a potential solution, we examine the impact of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)’s policy that closely controls the quantity produced by manufacturers and the quantity purchased by health care delivery organizations. Our results suggest that enacting similar controls at the start of future pandemics for related drugs could be an effective method to reduce stockpiling. Our paper has implications for policymakers and drug manufacturers in terms of preparing for future pandemics."
